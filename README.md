# 🚀 `React Projects Collection`

This repository showcases **`10 beginner to intermediate-level projects`** built using **React.js** and **CSS**. These projects are designed to strengthen core concepts in React such as components, state management, props, conditional rendering, events, and API integration — along with styling using plain CSS.
